While the project is in early development, meli will only be developed for the
linux kernel and respected linux distributions. Support for more UNIX-like OSes
is on the roadmap.

DEVELOPMENT
===========

Development builds can be built and/or run with

# cargo build
# cargo run

There is a debug/tracing log feature that can be enabled by using the flag
`--feature debug-tracing` or in a development profile in Cargo.toml. The logs
are printed in stderr, thus you can run meli with a redirection (i.e `2> log`)

CONFIG
======

meli by default looks for a configuration file in this location:
# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meli/config

You can run meli with arbitrary configuration files by setting the MELI_CONFIG
environment variable to their locations, ie:

# MELI_CONFIG=./test_config cargo run

TESTING
=======

How to run specific tests:

# cargo test -p {melib, ui, meli} (-- --nocapture) (--test test_name)

PROFILING
=========

# perf record -g target/debug/bin
# perf script | stackcollapse-perf | rust-unmangle | flamegraph > perf.svg
