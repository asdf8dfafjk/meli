NAME
      meli - Meli Mail User Agent. Meli is the Greek word for honey.

STARTING WITH meli
      When launched for the first time, meli will search for its configuration directory ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meli/). If it doesn't exist, you will be asked if you want to create one along with a sample configuration. The sample configuration ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meli/config) includes comments with the basic settings required for setting up accounts allowing you to copy and edit right away.

      At any time, you can press `?` to show a searchable list of all available actions and shortcuts, along with every possible setting and command that your version supports.

      The main visual navigation tool is the left-side sidebar. The menu's visibility can be toggled (default shortcut _) and can be moved with the X setting. [SCROLLING and OPENING, ACCOUNT / FOLDER SETTINGS]

      The view into each folder has 3 modes: plain, threaded and compact. Plain views each mail indvidually, threaded shows their thread relationship visually, and compact includes one entry per thread of emails.
