DOCUMENTATION
=============

After installing meli, see meli(1) and meli.conf(5) for documentation.

BUILDING
========

meli requires rust 1.34 and rust's package manager, Cargo. Information on how
to get it on your system can be found here:

https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html

With Cargo available, the project can be built with 

# make

The resulting binary will then be found under target/release/meli

Run:

# make install

to install the binary and man pages. This requires root, so I suggest you override the default paths and install it in your $HOME:

# make PREFIX=$HOME/.local install

See meli(1) and meli.conf(5) for documentation.

You can build and run meli with one command:

# cargo run --release

While the project is in early development, meli will only be developed for the
linux kernel and respected linux distributions. Support for more UNIX-like OSes
is on the roadmap.

DEVELOPMENT
===========

Development builds can be built and/or run with

# cargo build
# cargo run 2> debug.log

The debug logs can be disabled by setting debug-assertions to false in the
development profile in Cargo.toml. In the future debug logs will be a feature.

CONFIG
======

meli by default looks for a configuration file in this location:
# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meli/config

You can run meli with arbitrary configuration files by setting the MELI_CONFIG
environment variable to their locations, ie:

# MELI_CONFIG=./test_config cargo run 2> debug.log

TESTING
=======

How to run specific tests:

# cargo test -p {melib, ui, meli} (-- --nocapture) (--test test_name)

PROFILING
=========

# perf record -g target/debug/bin
# perf script | stackcollapse-perf | rust-unmangle | flamegraph > perf.svg
